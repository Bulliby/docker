# The Bulliby's Dockerfiles

This is my personal dockerfles, i choose to take as base image Archlinux, becasue this is the distribution I know better. 

* I will publish soon some docker for CVE exploitation for specific app.
* I will learn to use some minimalist distribution like alpine to move my dockerfiles to.
